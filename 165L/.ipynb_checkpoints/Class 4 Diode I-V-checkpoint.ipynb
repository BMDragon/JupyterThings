    "# Experiment -- Measuring I vs V curve part 2:  I vs V for a diode\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recap:  Resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week you measured I vs V for a device called a resistor, which is simply a material (usually thin metal film or carbon) designed to resist the flow of charges through it.  You found a relationship between I and V that was highly linear.  This is called Ohm's Law, and the slope of the fit line between I and V is termed the **resistance, R** of the material, measured in Ohms  (1 $\\Omega$ = 1 Volt per Ampere).  Since this relationship is almost universal for uniform materials able to conduct current, we write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = IR $$\n",
    " \n",
    "Resistance is a property of both material and geometry.  We can calculate resistance of a given object from this relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R = \\rho\\frac{l}{A} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\rho$ is the innate electrical **resistivity** of a given material, and $l$ is the path length of that material through which charges must flow, and $A$ is the cross sectional area of that material that current will flow through.  \n",

    "### Determinations of resistivity\n",
    "\n",
    "It stands to reason that by careful determination of material length and Area, and by careful measurement of resistance, you can determine the *resistivity* of  a given material by reversing the relationship above.  This is in practice how resistivity is often found.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conductance\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in some situations, where you are interested in how much current is caused by a given amount of voltage.  It may make sense to use the *inverse* of resistance.  This has a unit too!  \n",

    "\n",
    "You may encounter this unit in scientific research because it is sometimes easier to speak of the amount of current caused by a certain potential difference than vice versa.\n"

    "## Next steps:  Measuring I vs V for a diode\n",
    "\n",
    "A diode is a *semiconductor device* made by sandwiching two semiconductor crystals together.  A P-type semiconductor, because of its structure, has an excess of positive regions (called 'holes') and a shortage of electrons. An N-type semiconductor has an excess of negative charge carriers (electrons).  When the two are put together, they create a **diode**, which is a device that *only conducts current in one direction*, and which displays a nonlinear behavior in regards to its V vs I relationship.  This is due to the **physics of the junction between the N-type and P-type semiconductor material** and the behavior of this junction when an electric field is applied to it (e.g. from a voltage source across the diode).  \n",

    "### A comment on Ground or \"Common\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists and engineers typically omit drawing wires for the 0 voltage point in the circuit, the place to which all current returns to the 0 Volt side of the power supply.  If it will help you can mentally connect all of the Ground (GND) symbols together with a wire,  but in practice an actual wire is rarely used to create a ground, and it is bad practice to do so except when making prototypes on a boardboard where no other options exist.   Since this is the place to which all current flow in the circuit will return, and because it is at 0 volts, all ground points of a circuit are typically connected to the metal chassis (housing) of the circuit, or to a thick plane of copper on the back side of a printed circuit board.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"ground\" comes from the fact that when wiring buildings, the third prong (ground terminal) of an electrical outlet is in fact connected to the Earth using a long metal pole driven down near a building's foundation.  This ground terminal is in fact connected to the metal enclosures of electrical appliances (like toasters and ovens), and acts as a safety measure because any faults in a circuit will not be able to harm people, as leaking current would be conducted down from the appliance's housing to the Earth (instead of through the user's body).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In small electronic devices, this kind of grounding is rarely done, since voltages are low, typically between 1 and 10 volts.  However if you ever have reason to work with high voltages, you must (1) go through proper training to be able to do so safely and (2) be sure to actually *Earth ground* the metal enclosure housing your circuitry!  \n",
    "\n",
    "**In this class**, when *you* build circuits, you can simply use a breadboard wire to connect all Ground points back to the negative terminal (the 0V terminal, in fact) of the battery.  In the case of a circuit breadboard there is no other option.  \n"
