    "# Week 2.  Collecting data from instrumentation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2 of today's laboratory will be your first introduction to instrumentation and data collection methods.  The force sensors (technically *strain gauges*) and digital multimeters are professional quality equipment capable of high precision measurements!  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is this lab about?\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will be thinking about uncertainty due to random noise -- the kind we can study statistically. We will measure and study the very real sensor noise that is inherent in our instrumentation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is because want to  understand exactly *how precise and accurate our measurements can be* -- we want to figure out what level of uncertainty, due to random fluctuations, that our apparatus exhibits.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**All laboratory measurements are subject to random errors**.  This means that all experimental researchers must understand them, and how to deal with them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What comes next?\n",
    "\n",
    "After our noise measurement today, we will next deal with **linear systematic error** that all sensors possess.  We may have time to begin **calibrating our sensors** this week, or we may begin next week, depending on time available.  This means producing a calibration equation, so that we may take the raw sensor data (a voltage value) and easily convert this into a *meaningful measure of force* (in Newtons).\n",
    "\n",
    "Important themes today:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Studying the inherent statistical uncertainty in our **system**.\n",
    "* Making decisions about how best to use your instrumentation, to measure with maximum accuracy and minimum uncertainty.\n",
    "* Thinking critically about how your measurement techniques and analysis methods affect the quality of your results or determinations.\n",
    "* Graphing your data and looking for mathematical relationships.\n",
    "* Documenting what you do, as you do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. Initial setup\n",
    "\n",
    "To talk to our apparatus, we will use a special Python tool-kit called the **PyVISA** module, that we have installed on the laboratory computers.  This is basically a set of drivers and functions that enable us to talk to any laboratory instrumentation that follows what is called the \"VISA\" protocol standard (nothing to do with credit cards!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The VISA protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "VISA stands for [**Virtual instrument software architecture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_instrument_software_architecture).  The underyling idea is that the same set of commands can be used to computer-control electronic laboratory instruments from many different manufacturers. This means that less time is spent worrying about quirks of specific devices;  if a Techtronix voltmeter and a Rigol voltmeter both speak the same \"language\" then the same computer program should be able to talk to either of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "The VISA protocol is probably the major industry standard method of communicating with data collection instruments at present.  It consists of keyword commands that are sent to an instrument through some kind of hardware connection (such as a **serial cable**, **USB cable**, **bluetooth**, etc.).  The VISA instrument in return sends back data that those commands have requested.  The data is sent back along the same connection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Serial cables, USB connections and bluetooth are all *two-way* **serial communications** channels. *Serial* means that data is sent through the connection one *data bit* at a time, serially, in some kind of ordered and time synchonized way. The important point here is that VISA is a **high level communications protocol** -- you shouldn't need to know details of how your hardware is sending data bits and bytes!  All you should need to know is *that a connection exists and that there is a set of Python commands that allow you to send data along that connection.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connect your instrument\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure that your Rigol DMM has a USB cable connected to the port in the back of the instrument.  Plug the other end of the USB cable into your laboratory computer **before** loading up Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure your strain gauge amplifier is connected to the measurement inputs of the Rigol multimeter! Your instructor will assist you in making these connections.\n",

    "## 1.  We have to import our modules\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modules are sets of commands (functions) that extend the Python language.  Each module we import gives us the ability to do something different with Python.   There are modules for working with Excel spreadsheets, for doing 3D graphics, for creating video games, for doing numerical processing, for developing web applications, and an uncountable number of other purposes.\n",

If x doesn't exist (there are no numbers stored in your computer's memory under the name x) then the command above will give you an **error** because it can't run properly!  \n",
    "\n",
    "All commands (we'll call them functions from now on) have parentheses on the end.   Very much like a mathematical function,  if the python function takes any **input** then that input is given inside the parentheses.  If the function takes no input, then there are just a pair of empty parentheses.  For example:\n",
